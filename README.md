<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A variety of substances called non-enzymatic proteins are found in numerous biological systems. They give structure, facilitate transportation, act as binders, and much more to these biological systems. However, unlike their enzymatic counterparts, we are still unaware of their behavior as potential active matter. To investigate this, we created a setup that will help us observe these systems under an electric field.

The initial portion of our research was about creating a setup to carry out our experiment. We ensured that our system was as isolated as possible from conducting surfaces and other external factors.

The main portion of our experiment consisted of using the plain/BSA-coated polystyrene beads and observing it with and without an electric field. We used Tracker and Python (Trackpy) to track and analyze our observations. We observed some changes when BSA-coated polystyrene is introduced in an electric field by looking at the graphs and charts from our analysis.

## How did we analyze the data?

- [ ] Trackpy is a Python package that tracks particle-like features in video images, follows them over time, and analyses their trajectories. It began as a Python implementation of the widely used Crocker-Grier algorithm. The soft matter research community very often uses it to track particles. The advantage it brings to the table is it allows us to track multiple particles (all particles in the frame) and give results on their movement. 

- [ ] Tracker is an open-source software that is used to track objects in a video. This software has inbuilt utilities to plot graphs and get best-fitting curves which makes the analysis easier and streamlined.
